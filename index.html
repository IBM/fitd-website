          <p>
            Following the advancement of large language models (LLMs), the development of LLM-based autonomous agents has become increasingly prevalent. As a result, the need to understand the security vulnerabilities of these agents has become a critical task. We examine how ReAct agents can be exploited using a straightforward yet effective method we refer to as the \emph{foot-in-the-door} attack.
            Our experiments show that indirect prompt injection attacks, prompted by harmless and unrelated requests (such as basic calculations) can significantly increase the likelihood of the agent performing subsequent malicious actions.
            Our results show that once a ReAct agent's thought includes a specific tool or action, the likelihood of executing this tool in the subsequent steps increases significantly, as the agent seldom re-evaluates its actions. 
            Consequently, even random, harmless requests can establish a ‘foot-in-the-door’, allowing an attacker to embed malicious instructions into the agent's thought process, making it more susceptible to harmful directives.
            To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose implementing a simple reflection mechanism that prompts the agent to reassess the safety of its actions during execution, which can help reduce the success of such attacks.          </p>

          ReAct setup with various attack scenarios. The agent is informed of its tools via the system prompt (1). 
          Attacks like Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) and Foot-in-the-Door (FITD) inject instructions into observations from external tools (2).
           FITD differs by the position and timing of distractor requests. In unfamiliar FITD, the agent can't use the distractor tool, causing invalid results.
            Thought Injection (TI) places both actions in the agent's thought (3), while Harmless Thought Injection (HTI) includes only the benign request

          Our Foot-in-the-Door (FITD) attack proves significantly more effective than the baseline IPI (indirect prompt injection) across the board.
          For familiar FITD (where the agent know the distractor that is used for FITD), ASR increased by almost double in many cases.
          The combined IPI+FITD+TI method, that manipulate and inject the agent a thought achieves the highest ASR, reaching 99.2% on Mixtral and 97.1% on average,

        This heatmap compares the success rates (ASR) of FITD attacks based on the position and timing of the distractor across four models.
        The x-axis represents the timing (early or late action), and the y-axis represents the position (early or late) within the input.
        Results show that earlier placement (Position0) and earlier timing (Time0) consistently lead to higher ASR, indicating that starting with the distractor before the malicious request is the most effective approach, aligning with the original psychological foot-in-the-door effect. 
        The position of the distractor has a greater impact than timing (as can be seen in the heatmap - the difference between the top and bottom rows is more significant than the difference between the left and right columns).
